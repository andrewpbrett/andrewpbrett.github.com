I do believe that this will be the first time in the history of this blog (if
you don't count NYTimes letters and writings on
[Gristmill](http://gristmill.grist.org)) that I'll be linking to something
that I had a hand in writing:

  
[Democracy, GDP, and Natural Disasters](http://www.geotimes.org/current/articl
e.html?id=feature_democracy.html).

  
Frank Greve, a journalist who apparently writes for the [McClatchey Washington
Bureau](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/goodnews/story/20380.html) and both the
[English](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/goodnews/story/20380.html) and
[Spanish](http://www.elnuevoherald.com/209/story/102358.html) language
versions of the Miami Herald, wrote an article about the original paper as
well.
