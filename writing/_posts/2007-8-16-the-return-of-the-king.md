title: "The Return of the King"

Well since it appears that:

  
- Blogger does not delete your account after an extremely long period of inactivity;  

- Many many many friends and acquaintances are going to be (or are already) in locations of extremely wide geographical diversity;

- Much has happened since January of 2006;

I have decided to (hopefully) begin writing in this space on occasion. The
subject matter may be more personal than it has been in the past, or it might
be similar. We'll see. Hopefully there will be more pictures, in any case.
