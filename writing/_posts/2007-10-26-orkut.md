On the heels of Microsoft buying a stake in Facebook, I thought I'd create an
account over at [orkut](http://www.orkut.com), Google's social networking
site, just out of curiosity.

  
I have to say, I don't like what I saw. I now have 'close' friends versus
acquaintances? I'm asked to list my fashion sense (and am given a series of
multiple choices)? Hmm. Doesn't sit well. The sample pages I randomly took a
look at weren't too promising either. Facebook is also more aesthetically
pleasing as well.

  
Perhaps things will start changing as Google's [social netwoking
project](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/07/googles-social-networking-
projects.html) starts to take off. For now my account with orkut will likely
remain fairly defunct.

  
Historical note: first ever post via mobile phone.

  
Update: Google [will open](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/technology/31goog

malink) the orkut platform to developers.
