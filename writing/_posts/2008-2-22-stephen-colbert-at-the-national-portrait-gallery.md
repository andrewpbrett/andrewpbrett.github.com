title: "Stephen Colbert at the National Portrait Gallery"
---
Last night around 6:15 a coworker and I were feeling spontaneous, so we
decided to go to the [National Portrait Gallery](http://www.npg.si.edu/) and
see [Stephen Colbert's portrait](http://www.npg.si.edu/exhibit/colbert.htm).
There was a bit of traffic so we got there at about 6:55 - the Gallery closes
at 7:00. The conversation with the woman at the front desk went something
like:

  
Woman: "You know we're closing in five minutes, right?"

  
Me: "Right -- we just want to see Stephen Colbert"

  
Woman: (rolling not just her eyes, but her entire head). "How did I know. I
don't even have to ask anymore. Go through the courtyard, up the stairs on
your right. He's by the bathroom."

  
Me: "Thank you!"

  
I feel honored to have seen this national treasure before it is removed on
April 1st. And to have used the bathroom that it stands beside.
