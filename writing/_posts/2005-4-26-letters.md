Attention, Clevleand Plain Dealer:

  
Before you publish letters like [this](http://www.cleveland.com/letters/plaind
ealer/index.ssf?/base/opinion/1114507990120821.xml), can you at least demand
some sort of coherent argument from the writer? This is a quote: "Don't even
think about asserting that [global warming is] a direct result of me driving
my SUV 12,000 miles a year."

  
That's how the writer ends the letter. Were you going to tell us why we're not
allowed to assert that, Carl? Or just leave it where it stands, which is an
unfounded and misinformed reaction to the fact that Cleveland is under a foot
of snow right now. If this writer had actually read some predictions about the
subject, he would know that increased variability in weather (and thus,
snowfall on April 25th) is a possible side effect of global warming. Climate
_change_ will affect all parts of the world differently as weather patterns
change and become more variable. Maybe the solution to convincing people like
this is to let them know that parts of the world (Cleveland) might get colder
and snowier, probably the last thing that Carl wants.
