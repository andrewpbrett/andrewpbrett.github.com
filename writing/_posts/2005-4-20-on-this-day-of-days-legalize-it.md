title: "On this day of days: Legalize it"

I don't think it's a coincidence that
[this](http://blog.mises.org/blog/archives/003501.asp) wound up in my RSS
inbox from the Mises Institute today of all days. This is by far the most
persuasive argument for legalization in my opinon (the economic one). US $13.9
billion annually in savings and revenue? Let's go. Rumor had it that Marlboro
had patented "Marlboro Greens" for the day when this happened, but I have
searched and searched and cannot find any hard evidence that this is any more
than just a rumor.
