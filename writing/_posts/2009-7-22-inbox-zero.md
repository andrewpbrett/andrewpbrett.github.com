title: "Inbox: Zero. Google Reader: not so much"
---
I'm a big advocate of the "Inbox Zero" philosophy of email management. I don't
have the [merit badge](http://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/products/inbox-zero),
and I don't think it needs to be [quite so
extensive](http://www.43folders.com/izero), but I still like to keep things
pristine.


My RSS reader is another story; I rarely clear it out entirely. When I go
through the items (once per day), I'll mark a few choice ones as unread for
further perusal and keep plugging through the chaff. Once I start to hit
things that I've seen before, it means I've finished the boring part.


There's usually somewhere between 10 and 25 items, spread over a week or so,
that remain marked as unread. These savory morsels get read, re-read, shared,
emailed, or (theoretically) turned into fodder for blog posts. The best ones
[are approved by the Senate and become a law!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-oQ) -- er, get starred and
saved for all time.


I prefer this system over the inbox zero method because it allows the ideas in
the posts to seep a little deeper into the gray matter. It's a fundamentally
different mindset that you're in; often if someone emails me an article I'll
use [this handy bookmarklet](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/share-
anything-anytime-anywhere.html) to get it into Reader and then move it to a
separate folder.


I still haven't decided what to do with the [new features the Reader team
keeps rolling out](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/07/following-liking-
and-people-searching.html), though.
