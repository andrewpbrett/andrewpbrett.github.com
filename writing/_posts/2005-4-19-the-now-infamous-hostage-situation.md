title: "The now-infamous hostage situation"

[This](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4455657.stm) situation has been
really interesting to follow. Initially, there were reports that Sunnis had
taken up to 150 hostages in a town south of Baghdad, as it turns out, this
never happened, but the Iraqi Security Force went into the town, which is now
becoming a source of contention since it looks like it may have just been
fabricated by the Shiites to flex their muscles. The [Iraq
Blogs](http://www.iraqwires.com) have been covering the rise and fall of this
"fake crisis."
