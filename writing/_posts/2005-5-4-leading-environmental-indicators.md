title: "Leading Environmental Indicators"

[Filibustering](http://www.filibusterfrist.com) went well this morning; the
time really flew by. I wound up reading _The Outward Bound Wilderness First
Aid Handbook_, one of my favorites.

  
On a non-filibuster topic (and I won't even get into how ridiculous the
HardBall interviews were), the Pacific Research Institute released their
[Index of Leading Environmental Indicators](http://www.pacificresearch.org/pub
/sab/enviro/05_enviroindex/index.html). It's on my to do list.
