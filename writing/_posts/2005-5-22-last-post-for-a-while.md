title: "Last post for a while"

Since I am leaving tomorrow morning at 8:45 for the Shenandoahs, and I have an
obscene amount of things to take care of before I lose access to email for a
week, this will be my last post until at least next Friday and possibly
longer. This, unfortunatly, means I'll probably miss the resolution of the
[filibuster](http://www.filibusterfrist.com) debate. Bummer.

  
This will also be the first time since taking my Wilderness First Responder
course that I will be without internet access for an extended period of time.
That seems so long ago. Hell, the post before this seems so long ago, I was
surprised that I hadn't missed a day or three between updates. If big news
happens, leave me a comment about it. It's better than sifting through 400
stories from the Guardian in an RSS box.
