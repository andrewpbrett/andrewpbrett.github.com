_But after Katrina, the trend reversed and the skeptics became a majority,
with 56 percent viewing government as mostly wasteful._

  
That's from John Tierney today. All you ProQuesters can find it [here](http://
proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=901866791&sid=1&Fmt=3&clientId=17210&RQT=309&VNam
e=PQD). The whole thing is good, better than that excerpt.

  
You'll also notice that I now have to use ProQuest to read the NYT columnists,
since they are jerks and it's a paid subscription now. In (perhaps related)
news, the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com) is no longer subscription.
Oh the times they are a-changin'....
