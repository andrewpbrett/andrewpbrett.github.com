title: "Santorum and Stewart"

I watched Jon Stewart [interview](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily
_show/videos/celebrity_interviews/index.jhtml) Rick Santorum last week on _The
Daily Show_. I agree with the number of people who have called it a softball
interview, but then again, there's a difference between _The Daily Show_ and
_Crossfire_ (thank god).

  
The flaw in Santorum's arguments (which Stewart graciously allowed us to hear)
is that he thinks that in order to build character in children as they are
raised, we need to protect them from what he views as a corrupt culture that
"surrounds" them.

  
Wouldn't it take more character to calmly view the "corrupt" culture for what
it is and reject it instead of never being exposed to it at all?
