title: "Facebook Notes"

I've decided to try out adding this blog's feed to my Facebook Notes
application, in hopes that 1) I will post more regularly, and 2) Said posts
will be more widely viewed.

  
So if you are reading this in note form, I will try not to get all up in your
grill (i.e. your newsfeed) with lots of pointless posts. If you prefer to keep
tabs in a more direct, non-facebook-assisted manner, the blog itself, with its
beautiful custom design, can be found
[here](http://citingthetext.blogspot.com).
