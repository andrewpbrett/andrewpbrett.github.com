I am currently talking online to Leroy, OH, via SKYPE! Or as I like to call
it, (pun intended) the greatest thing since sliced bread. Take [Tom Friedman's
advice](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/13/opinion/13friedman.html?n=Top%2fOpin
ion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fOp%2dEd%2fColumnists%2fThomas%20L%20Friedma
n). Go to [Skype.com](http://www.skype.com) and download it now. If you are at
Princeton and have one of those standard-issue Dells you don't even need a
microphone or headset or anything. It's great!
