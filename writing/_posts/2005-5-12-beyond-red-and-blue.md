[This post](http://www.mydd.com/story/2005/5/12/133854/685) at MyDD is really
interesting. Not only does this [study](http://people-
press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=943) go, as promised, beyond red and
blue, but it provides a questionnaire (one page) that you can [fill
out](http://typology.people-press.org/typology/) to determine which group you
would have fallen into had you taken the survey. The questionnaire itself is a
little lacking, since you only have four choices for each question and some of
the wording is dubious. But very worth a look.

  
Apparently, I am an "upbeat," which Chris Bowers is ready to throw in with the
Republicans, and which one of the commenters has
[identified](http://www.mydd.com/comments/2005/5/12/133854/685/3#3) as the
"mythical swing voter."
