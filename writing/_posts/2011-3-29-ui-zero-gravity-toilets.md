title: "UI and Zero Gravity Toilets"

As I'm building out the user interface for [Cake
Health](http://cakehealth.com), I'm constantly running into a problem that
many people face when building an application: *You* know exactly how it works
and how it's supposed to function, but a first-time user is almost certainly
going to be lost.

It's so easy to say "I'll use a wizard" or "I'll add some helper text, or a
tool tip" - but this is almost always the wrong decision. [If you find
yourself having to explain the interface, you've already
lost](http://twitter.com/BillNguyen/status/52575405953126400).

One of my favorite scenes from "2001: A Space Odyssey" features the main
character poring over a long list of instructions for using a Zero Gravity
Toilet:

His pensive expression is presumably caused by the race between Nature's
increasingly insistent call and his rate of reading comprehension.

Similar instructions can be seen in other shots. It puts a subtle but poignant
addition on the film's theme that technology has advanced to a "magical" level
and yet has also rendered its creators totally dependent on its sometimes
flawed design.

Moral of the story: if you start to see instructions on your interface, stop.
Pretend that understanding it is the only thing preventing your users from
relieving themselves in zero gravity.
