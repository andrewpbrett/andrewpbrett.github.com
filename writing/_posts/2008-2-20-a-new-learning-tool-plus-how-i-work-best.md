[LiveMocha](http://www.livemocha.com/) might just be the ticket to push me
over the top in finally sticking with a new language. It was featured in the
[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/business/17novel.html?ex=13
60990800&en=284f2adf8221c428&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink)
yesterday and also kindly emailed to me by
[Grace](http://web.mac.com/gracerwright). I have completed lesson 1 in Espanol
and am very pleased with the combination of audio and text. The site itself is
aesthetically pleasing and you feel like you are playing a game, especially
with the Magnet ("make a sentence") section.

  
The site also allows you to submit samples of writing and even speaking in the
language you are learning, and leverages the power of the masses to give you
feedback - every time you submit something, you are given the option of
reviewing another person's submission in YOUR native language. Brilliant!

  
Side note for the record: I took the [Myers-Briggs Type
Indicator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) test (or
one version of it, the one that popped up first on Google). It typed me as an
ENTJ. To translate: **E**xtroverted, not Introverted; i**N**tution, not
Sensing; **T**hinking, not Feeling; and **J**udging, not Perceiving. I note
this here only because I tend to forget quickly and then have to take the test
again, and probably register a different result every time. Now I can test
this hypothesis.

  
Tomorrow: the news from Old Nassau.
