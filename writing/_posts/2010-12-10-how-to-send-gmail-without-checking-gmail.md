title: "How To Send Gmail Without Checking Gmail"
---
Maintaining focus while working independently can be a daunting task. I'm
slowly but surely ramping up my ability to be fully disciplined and focused on
one thing at a time, for extended periods of time.

This [advice from Caterina Fake](http://caterina.net/archive/001158.html) has
been invaluable. I have been unlearning the habit of constantly checking my
email, and it's probably the one thing that's had the single greatest impact
on my ability to focus. If you look closely you'll notice that while you're
only checking email once every three hours during the day, you should "send
anytime." This is key - but how can you do that?

Like most people I know, I use the web client for Gmail, so in order to send
an email you have to go to Gmail and at the very least you get a brief glimpse
of your inbox. For me, that brief glimpse is enough to start consuming brain
cycles. There are a number of Chrome extensions and little helper programs
that supposedly let you send without seeing your inbox, but I've found the
easiest thing is to just bookmark this link:

[https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs;=1&tf;=1](https://mail.google.com/ma
il/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1)

Easy enough. Hopefully this saves someone some time.
