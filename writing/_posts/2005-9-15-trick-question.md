So what career gives you the most potential to give back to society?

  
1. High-paying consultancy job where you are making $500,000 per year by
retirement and thus paying something like $200,000 in taxes, or

  
2. Low-paying job in the public sector where you you are making $80,000 a year
by retirement and paying $16,000 in taxes but, in theory, are directly serving
society.

  
Discuss.

  
The correct ([Mises](http://www.mises.org/quiz.asp?QuizID=4)) answer is 3, the
high-paying consultancy job where you are making $500,000 a year by retirement
and thus paying something like $10,000 in taxes.
