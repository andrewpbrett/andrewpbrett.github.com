Below is my first attempt at embedding a Google Map from MyMaps into a
website. The tacks represent the locations of people that I know, some of whom
are listed and linked to as "Fellow Travelers" on the right.

[View Larger Map](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&om=1&msid=111366003748394849176.000439ca56259a23388a7&ll=23.885838,2.8125&spn=127.350416,298.828125&z=1&source=embed)

Update on updating: Since the link is to a map in MyMaps, when I change that
map, the map here is updated automatically. So if you don't see your location,
tell me and I'll put it on there.
