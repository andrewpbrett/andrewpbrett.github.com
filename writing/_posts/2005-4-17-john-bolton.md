John Bolton should have to explain [this
incident](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/4/15/101542/050) before he gets
anywhere near a diplomatic position of any kind. I would be interested to hear
what he has to say about allegations like this one:

> Mr. Bolton proceeded to chase me through the halls of a Russian hotel --
throwing things at me, shoving threatening letters under my door and,
generally, behaving like a madman. For nearly two weeks, while I awaited fresh
direction from my company and from US AID, John Bolton hounded me in such an
appalling way that I eventually retreated to my hotel room and stayed there.
Mr. Bolton, of course, then routinely visited me there to pound on the door
and shout threats.

and

> He indicated to key employees of or contractors to State that, based on his
discussions with investigatory officials, I was headed for federal prison and,
if they refused to cooperate with either him or the prime contractor's
replacement team leader, they, too, would find themselves the subjects of
federal investigation.

In the interest of transparancy, I read this via [truthout's
website](http://www.truthout.org/index.htm).
