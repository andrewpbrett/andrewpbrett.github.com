title: "Now With Photo Hosting!"

As I [mentioned](http://andybrett.com/where-this-is-going) a while ago, I
eventually would like all the content I put online to "live" on this domain as
its permanent home. This includes images, so I'm happy to report that after a
bit of tinkering with [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip),
I'm now set up to do just that with images.

It's extremely bare bones right now, but it's functional, and I think it's
better to ship the code and start using it rather than wait until it's perfect
(thanks [Matt](http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/)).

You can check out the (rather sparse) [collection](photos) so far - I'll
likely be doing a mass import soon with what I currently have on Picasa.
