For all the hubbub about the Supreme Court's ruling in _Kelo v. City of New
London_ that eminent domain could be applied to cases where "economic
development" was the public use in question, the response of the state
legislatures [has been
swift](http://www.castlecoalition.org/legislation/states/index.asp). The
decision did not prevent states from making their own laws regarding the scope
of eminent domain, and public opposition to the ruling has been widspread and
bipartisan. An [article](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-02
-eminent-domain_x.htm?csp=34) in _USA TODAY_ detailed the states' response and
had this to say:

> In Washington, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said his office received more
calls from constituents angry about this case than it did for the Supreme
Court ruling that limited displays of the Ten Commandments on public property

...

"We don't like anybody messing with our dogs, our guns, our hunting rights or
trying to take property from us," says [Alabama] state Sen. Jack Biddle, a
sponsor of the law.

The [Castle Coalition](http://www.castlecoalition.org) is a great resource for
eminent domain issues and activism if you're so inclined.
