Welcome to the latest incarnation of Citing the Text, most recently
[hosted](http://citingthetext.blogspot.com) by Blogger. It's been a long time
since the days of Xanga; hopefully this latest version is a little easier on
the eyes.


I recently [wrote about](http://citingthetext.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-
debian-lenny-enterprise-ruby.html) how I decided to overhaul this site's
architecture. This new blogging platform is the first of many features that
the redesign will enable.


In the spirit of getting things out there in front of real users and iterating
in response to feedback, this blog is being released in a deliberately
unfinished state. It is certainly not a design masterpiece by any stretch, but
it's something to build on.


Lastly, a million thanks to Ryan Bates and his always useful and inspirational
[Railscasts](http://www.railscasts.com).
