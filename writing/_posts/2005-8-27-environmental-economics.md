[Very important and interesting discussion](http://www.env-
econ.net/2005/08/green_vs_povert.html) going on over at Environmental
Economics on "Green vs. Poverty." I've already thrown my two cents in -- the
professor was Oppenheimer this spring. John Whitehead has a good concluding
(for now) remark.

  
I'm also going to have to look into this Bjorn character.
