title: "Frist Filibuster"
---
Over the past 54 hours, there has been a filibuster going on at the Frist
Campus Center to protest Bill Frist threatening to use the nuclear option to
take away the filibuster for judicial nominees. The website with updates is
[here](http://progrev.blogspot.com); the live webcam is
[here](http://www.princeton.edu/~petehill/filibuster.html).

  
My understanding is that the plan is to go for as long as people are willing
to read. This could be a very long time since classes are over this week. I am
interested to see the interaction at about 2 AM tonight between the
protestor(s) (hopefully plural) and the revelers staggering home, as the
protest is right on the way back from the parties...

  
Just listening to students walking by, the protest is certainly getting talked
about. In addition to just what I've been hearing, there have been two
articles in the Daily Princetonian, and a mention on CNN's "Inside the Blogs"
(see above sites for links). However, it's a little disconcerting that a lot
of the comments I have heard have been along the lines of "What are they
protesting?" or "So are they for or against the filibuster?" I don't really
think that it's all that important what the initial reaction is-just that
there is a reaction and that people are finding out about what is going on
here.

  
I could see this thing easily going for a really extended period of time. As
in weeks.
