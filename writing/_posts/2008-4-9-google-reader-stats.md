title: "Google Reader Stats"

Inspired by [Atul Gawande](http://www.gawande.com/)'s advice to "measure
something," I decided to start keeping track of how long I spent each day
tabbing through items in my Google Reader. Naturally, I have made this process
a [batch process](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/02/18/how-to-stop-
checking-e-mail-on-the-evenings-and-weekends/), done once per weekday.

  
It has now been one week, so I have five data points. I wanted to see if any
strong trends emerged, so I put the data in a Google Spreadsheet, publicly
available
[here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCyO8doXJBwJZt6lkrYIhRw). I'm
still tooling around with it, but I was also excited to try out the [gadget
feature](http://googlegadgetsapi.blogspot.com/2008/03/new-possibilities-with-
gadgets.html), which should let me embed the two charts I came up with right
on my blog as gadgets:

  
  
  
  
  
Nothing tremendously interesting or pretty, but for right now I just wanted to
see if the pipes could be connected so to speak.

  
One thing I noticed was that the standard scatterplot falls victim to standard
scatterplot syndrome: you can only display two values on it, i.e., you can't
make the points sized or colored based on a third or fourth column of values.

  
Thing is, there's a [developer's
API](http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/dev_guide.html) for these
things, but currently there are no available charts that allow for this multi-
dimensional type of scatter plot. I wonder if this is something that one could
knock out in a weekend...
