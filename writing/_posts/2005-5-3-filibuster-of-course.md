The Frist Filibuster Protest can be seen on HardBall tonight on MSNBC for
those with cable at 7 EDT, as well as on CNN tomorrow, presumably on Inside
Politics, but I don't know what time.

  
I will be reading at 8 AM tomorrow morning, which you can watch live on the
[webcam](http://www.filibusterfrist.com). I haven't settled on what to read
yet, so if you have any suggestions for reading material, let's hear them.

  
Currently being filibustered: "A Midsummer Night's Dream," as performed by the
"Filibuster Players."
