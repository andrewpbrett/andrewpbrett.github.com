title: "Monkey wrench of irrationality"
---
One thing that really throws a monkey wrench into my whole new [libertarian
philosophy](http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/07/ramble-on.html) is the
fact that people don't always behave rationally. Even decisions that we think
that we are basing on objective reasoning are actually often just gut
decisions that are far more instinctual.

  
This is why I'm glad that I'm taking The Psychology of Decision-making and
Judgement with Kahneman next semester. I hear his Nobel Prize winning stuff is
all about just that sort of thing.
