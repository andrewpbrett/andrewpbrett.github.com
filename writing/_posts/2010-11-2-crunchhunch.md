**TL;DR**: 

Guess who wrote the TechCrunch post based on the headline with
[Crunchhunch](http://crunchhunch.com).

**Long version**: 

A few weeks ago I was out to drinks with some friends when the topic of
TechCrunch headlines came up. I asserted that I could guess with "greater than
90% accuracy" who wrote a post based solely on the headline. It gets even
easier if you can see the image used in the excerpt.

Fast-forward to last Saturday, when I found myself with an unusual amount of
free time (funny, that). Having been reminded of the idea earlier that week
after [Paul](http://www.paulcarr.com)'s suggested domain name turned out to be
available, I decided to see what I could put together. A few hours later, and
[voila](http://crunchhunch.com). Since then I've made a few tweaks, courtesy
of the creative department (Paul), in the form of some copy edits and some
additions to what appears after a right/wrong answer.

Just a fun little app. Enjoy. If you're a designer and the site makes you want
to gouge your eyes out with your photoshop license, get in touch :-)
