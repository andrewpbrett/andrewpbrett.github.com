title: "Living like New Yorkers"
---
The previous post promised an update, which is obviously sorely overdue....

  
The assertion in the article that most strikes me is this: that "the best
strategy...is to make the rest of the world as rich as New York."

  
Is this not a physical impossibility? Every day in the dining hall at school
we were reminded that if the rest of the world lived like Americans it would
take five earths to support us.

  
The only way that this can happen is for people to subscribe to a new
definition of what it means to be 'rich.' The definition must place a higher
value on things that don't a) consume as many resources, and b) produce as
many carbon emissions.
