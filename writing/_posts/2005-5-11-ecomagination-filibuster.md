title: "Ecomagination, Filibuster"
---
GE launched a series of ads touting what it calls "ecomagination" two days
ago. Since then it's been mentioned at
[Gristmill](http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2005/5/8/222321/6123) and by
[Joel Makower](http://makower.typepad.com/joel_makower/), among others. It's
very exciting. And their
[sketchpad](http://www.geimaginationcubed.com/LaunchPage) is cool as well.

  
The [filibuster](http://www.filibusterfrist.com) continues, in Washington DC
now. Both NJ Senators are slated to speak.
