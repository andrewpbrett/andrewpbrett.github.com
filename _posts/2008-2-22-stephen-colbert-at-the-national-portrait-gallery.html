title: "Stephen Colbert at the National Portrait Gallery"
---
Last night around 6:15 a coworker and I were feeling spontaneous, so we decided to go to the <a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/">National Portrait Gallery</A> and see <a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/exhibit/colbert.htm">Stephen Colbert's portrait</A>. There was a bit of traffic so we got there at about 6:55 - the Gallery closes at 7:00. The conversation with the woman at the front desk went something like:<br /><br />Woman: "You know we're closing in five minutes, right?"<br /><br />Me: "Right -- we just want to see Stephen Colbert"<br /><br />Woman: (rolling not just her eyes, but her entire head). "How did I know. I don't even have to ask anymore. Go through the courtyard, up the stairs on your right. He's by the bathroom." <br /><br />Me: "Thank you!"<br /><br />I feel honored to have seen this national treasure before it is removed on April 1st. And to have used the bathroom that it stands beside.
