"[The Dissident](http://www.the-dissident.com/)" made its campus debut today,
and I have to say that while I was suspicious at first of a magazine that
seemed to espouse dissidence for its own sake, I thought some of the articles
were pretty good. One is by Bryan Caplan, who writes for EconLog if I'm not
mistaken. His [article](http://www.the-dissident.com/illiteracy.shtml) on
economic illiteracy was particularly good.

  
Working the [filibuster](http://www.filibusterfrist.com/) tomorrow from 8-12.
Come out! I am hoping that some of the people who have opposing views will be
up by now. I heard there was a spirited yet _extremely_ civil
debate/discussion last night. Good stuff.
