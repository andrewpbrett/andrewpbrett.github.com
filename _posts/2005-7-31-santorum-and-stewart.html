title: "Santorum and Stewart"
---
I watched Jon Stewart <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/videos/celebrity_interviews/index.jhtml">interview</A>  Rick Santorum last week on <em>The Daily Show</eM>. I agree with the number of people who have called it a softball interview, but then again, there's a difference between <em>The Daily Show</em> and <Em>Crossfire</em> (thank god). <br /><br />The flaw in Santorum's arguments (which Stewart graciously allowed us to hear) is that he thinks that in order to build character in children as they are raised, we need to protect them from what he views as a corrupt culture that "surrounds" them.<br /><br />Wouldn't it take more character to calmly view the "corrupt" culture for what it is and reject it instead of never being exposed to it at all?
