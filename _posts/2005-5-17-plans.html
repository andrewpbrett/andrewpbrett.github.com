After finishing up with "stormchasing" this summer in Baltimore, I am still trying to figure out what to do afterwards.  At this point, of course, I have completed registration, housing, etc. as though I were coming back to school as a junior, but I am also seriously contemplating taking a year off.  (I have been for a couple of weeks now; see parts <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/04/and-now-for-something-completely.html">one</A>, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/05/drinking-from-firehose-or-completely.html">two</a>, and <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/05/drinking-from-firehose-or-completely.html">three</a>.)<br /><br />The primary target as far as what I'd be doing has thus far been Engineers Without Borders.  I've been emailing with some people for them and if I did this it looks like I would wind up working on projects in either Macedonia or India.  This would be great.  The only thing is I don't know if it would last the whole nine or twelve months that I would be off of school.  I suppose I could say I'll start in September and work as long as possible and figure out the rest when I figure it out.  Figuring out if I would have living expenses covered is another huge question.  <br /><br />Doing something in the States would also be interesting as well.  I am keeping an ear to the ground for anything that might seem interesting; however, this is serving to convince me that maybe I should plan to do this after junior year and spend the whole year feeling out opportunities until something really cool comes along.  After all, I will most likely only take one year off, so it hypothetically really wouldn't matter when I did it.
