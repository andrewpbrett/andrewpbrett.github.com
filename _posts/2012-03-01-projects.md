###[Cake Health][1]

Cake Health is the easiest way to understand and optimize your health care.

###This site ([source][2])

Uses the [Jekyll][3] blogging engine by [Tom Preston-Warner][4] with some custom ruby glue to display images from Dropbox. 

###Old site ([source][5])

Archetypical Rails blog. Used Rails 3.0+, jQuery, HAML, and SASS. Allows for hosted images, posts, updates (a la twitter), and bookmarks, as well as privacy controls via tags for all of the above objects. Sends a daily email reminder to post something for posterity's sake.

###Crunchhunch ([source][6])

Fun little game that lets you guess the author of the TechCrunch post based on the headline. Based on a bet with Paul Carr. Not maintained.

###[CrunchBase][7]

Free database of startups and technology companies, investors and people that anyone can edit. I didn't build it but rather worked on new features for it while at TechCrunch. Built with Rails 2.x.
