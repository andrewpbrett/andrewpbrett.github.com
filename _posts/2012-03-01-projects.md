###[Move Loot][11]

[Move Loot](https://www.moveloot.com) is a marketplace for used furniture that's much easier than using Craigslist. I built the iPhone and iPad app (universal binary).

###[GTBee][10]

A simple to-do list iOS app that charges you for not Getting Things Done, via its integration with the [Beeminder API](https://www.beeminder.com/api).

###[Beeminder for iOS][9]

[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com) is a tool for fighting akrasia - in other words, making yourself do the things that you want to do. I wrote the iOS app.

###[Whimsical][0]

A spontaneous adventure generator for iOS.

###This site ([source][2])

Uses the [Jekyll][3] blogging engine by [Tom Preston-Warner][4].

###Old site ([source][5])

Archetypical Rails blog. Used Rails 3.0+, jQuery, HAML, and SASS. Allows for hosted images, posts, updates (a la twitter), and bookmarks, as well as privacy controls via tags for all of the above objects. Sends a daily email reminder to post something for posterity's sake.

###[CrunchBase][7]

Free database of startups and technology companies, investors and people that anyone can edit. I didn't build it but rather worked on new features for it while at TechCrunch. Built with Rails 2.x.
