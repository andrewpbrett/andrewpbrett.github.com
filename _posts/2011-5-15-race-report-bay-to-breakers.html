This will be a short one because of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/13/cake-health-wants-to-be-the-mint-for-health-insurance-beta-invites/">everything else that's going on</a> these days. 
</p>

I woke up a little before 5 am this morning to get the super-express Caltrain to the 2011 Bay to Breakers. I had missed the race last year, but it's been on my to-do list since moving out west and the 100th running seemed as good a time as any.</p>
<p>
While waiting for the start I witnessed the somewhat bizarre tradition wherein racers throw tortillas into the air, a la graduation mortarboards. The great-grandson of the winner of the first Bay to Breakers in 1912 rang the starting bell and we were off through the streets of SOMA. </p>
<p>
Things got sorted out after about a mile and I settled into a pretty good pace. At one point I narrowly avoided a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_to_Breakers#Centipedes">Centipede</a> that was preparing to make a sharp left hand turn. </p>
<p>The 2.5 mile mark and the Hayes Street hill arrived quickly. I decided not to completely attack the hill and aim for a more even effort, which worked out pretty well.</p>
<p>
The hill served to thin the pack out pretty well and we headed towards the panhandle. By this point I realized that at regular intervals, I would hear one of two things from the spectators - "Elvis!" and "Hey, she's naked". Two of the people in my immediate vicinity were 1) in a full-on Elvis costume, and 2) completely naked. The shouts continued for the rest of the race. 
</p>
<p>
The weather, despite the forecast, turned out to be beautiful, which highlighted what was already a great course. With about a mile to go a view opened up of the Pacific Ocean (and, yes, the breakers), which gave a nice little energy boost to the finish. <s>I'm still waiting on pictures but will post them once they're up.</s> <a href="http://images.partypics.com/events/2648/26487899/02204/0049.jpg">This one</a> is pretty good - here's <a href="http://images.partypics.com/events/2648/26487899/03505/0097.jpg">me and Elvis</a>.</p>
<p>
After finishing I made my way back along the course to watch Bay to Breakers part II: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704810504576307273357779498.html">the party</a>. </p>
<p>
I was happy with the time but I've pretty much been training through this race, as the Dipsea next month is the real target. If I were to post the same time there as I ran today, it would fare very well - there's just the matter of the vastly more challenging course to contend with.
