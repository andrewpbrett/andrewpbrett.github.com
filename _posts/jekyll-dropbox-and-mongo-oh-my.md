I'm thinking about migrating my personal site to Jekyll/GitHub. For a while I've self-hosted and used my personal site as a sandbox for trying out interesting new technologies. The latter won't be changing, but I've come to realize that while a [dorm room][1] is cool and all, there's plenty of other places for experimenting. Plus the mini-fridge is really starting to smell. 

More to be committed (!) soon.
