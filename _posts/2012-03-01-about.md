**TL;DR**: Bug fixer. Technical cofounder @[Cake Health][1]. Former techcruncher.

Andy Brett was born on September 26th in an undisclosed location in northeast Ohio. Educated first by his parents, and then by nuns, and finally by the [Socratic method][2], he left Ohio at the age of 17 with a tendency to ask impertinent questions, as well as real world experience as a [caddy][3], tutor, landscaper, camp counselor, and Panera sandwich artist. However, he wasn't headed for the real world but, rather, an undergraduate degree.

After four years, Andy emerged with said degree and a few more hats, including [Long Trail Patrolman][4], storm chaser, and [human health risk analyst][5]. While his degree is technically in Civil Engineering, the following four courses had the most direct impact on his education:

\- Macroeconomics

\- [Advanced Programming Techniques][6]

\- [High Tech Entrepreneurship][7]

\- [Investigating Natural Disasters][8]

After graduating, Andy began work for [Tiger Woods' IT guys][9], on projects such as the US Army's GFEBS accounting system and New York City's procurement system, and kept a [MetroCard][10], [CharlieCard][11], and [SmarTrip][12] card in his wallet at all times.

He eventually realized that working at a company with 180,000 of your closest friends has its drawbacks, and joined a much smaller startup in NYC, [RecycleBank][13], as a software engineer focused on Ruby on Rails and related tools.

Andy tends to take patterns to their logical conclusions. It was therefore only a matter of time before he moved to Silicon Valley and began working at an even smaller startup, [TechCrunch][14], solving tough problems and working on [CrunchBase][15].

After TechCrunch was [acquired][16], Andy struck out on his own once again and landed as the technical cofounder at [Cake Health][1], where he's currently working on making it easy to understand and manage your health care.

You can [follow him][17] on Twitter or [subscribe][18] to his posts. Or [email][19] and say hello.
