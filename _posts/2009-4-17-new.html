Welcome to the latest incarnation of Citing the Text, most recently <a href="http://citingthetext.blogspot.com">hosted</a> by Blogger. It's been a long time since the days of Xanga; hopefully this latest version is a little easier on the eyes.

I recently <a href="http://citingthetext.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-to-debian-lenny-enterprise-ruby.html">wrote about</a> how I decided to overhaul this site's architecture. This new blogging platform is the first of many features that the redesign will enable.

In the spirit of getting things out there in front of real users and iterating in response to feedback, this blog is being released in a deliberately unfinished state. It is certainly not a design masterpiece by any stretch, but it's something to build on.

Lastly, a million thanks to Ryan Bates and his always useful and inspirational <a href="http://www.railscasts.com">Railscasts</a>.
