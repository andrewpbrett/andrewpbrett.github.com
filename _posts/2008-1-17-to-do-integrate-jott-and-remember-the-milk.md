title: "To Do: Integrate Jott and Remember the Milk"
---
I've been using [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com) for a
little while now and have been pretty pleased with the results. Today I
stumbled across a service called [Jott](http://www.jott.com), which
transcribes voice into text and can emails you the result. Two obvious uses:
voicemails and transforming your phone into a personal voice recorder/to-do
list generator. Since Jott will send an email to any address you specify as a
contact, (e.g. your Remember the Milk inbox address), it's pretty easy to
integrate the two yourself by hand; however, poking around their blog revealed
that the smart people over there have [already thought of
that](http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2007/11/jott-your-tasks.html) and have
automated the process. Kudos.
