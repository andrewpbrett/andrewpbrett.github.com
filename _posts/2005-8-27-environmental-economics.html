<a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2005/08/green_vs_povert.html">Very important and interesting discussion</A> going on over at Environmental Economics on "Green vs. Poverty." I've already thrown my two cents in -- the professor was Oppenheimer this spring. John Whitehead has a good concluding (for now) remark.<br /><br />I'm also going to have to look into this Bjorn character.
