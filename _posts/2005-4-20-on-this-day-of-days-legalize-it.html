title: "On this day of days: Legalize it"
---
I don't think it's a coincidence that <a href="http://blog.mises.org/blog/archives/003501.asp">this</A> wound up in my RSS inbox from the Mises Institute today of all days.  This is by far the most persuasive argument for legalization in my opinon (the economic one).  US $13.9 billion annually in savings and revenue?  Let's go.  Rumor had it that Marlboro had patented "Marlboro Greens" for the day when this happened, but I have searched and searched and cannot find any hard evidence that this is any more than just a rumor.
