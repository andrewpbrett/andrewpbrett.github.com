The Frist Filibuster Protest can be seen on HardBall tonight on MSNBC for those with cable at 7 EDT, as well as on CNN tomorrow, presumably on Inside Politics, but I don't know what time.<br /><br />I will be reading at 8 AM tomorrow morning, which you can watch live on the <a href="http://www.filibusterfrist.com">webcam</A>.  I haven't settled on what to read yet, so if you have any suggestions for reading material, let's hear them.  <br /><br />Currently being filibustered: "A Midsummer Night's Dream," as performed by the "Filibuster Players."
