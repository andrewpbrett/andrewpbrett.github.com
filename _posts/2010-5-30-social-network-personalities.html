A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/andybrett/FLoRQUeaLpz/If-Facebook-is-the-people-you-went-to-high-school">remarked</a> on some of the differences I'd noticed between the people I was connected with on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Buzz. Generally speaking, I'd noticed that people on Buzz tend to be quite a bit smarter/wonkier than your average joe - "the people who actually did the reading [in class] and got really into it."

I now have some anecdotal evidence to back this up. Behold this <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/24/tcdisrupt-doerr-rose/">excellent Charlie Rose interview of John Doerr</a> from TechCrunch Disrupt, specifically the share counts on each network:

Charlie Rose is extremely talented at painting broad intellectual strokes and pulling out larger patterns, which is exactly what happened. Stimulating, but not really link bait - the retweet count is actually on the low side for a TechCrunch post. But the Buzz count is through the roof - higher than Facebook and nearly half of the retweet count.

Compare this with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/29/guy-who-copied-digg-slams-digg-for-copying-twitter/">Exhibit B</a>:

The post is much more controversial, but it's not really hitting any intellectual high notes. Barely any buzz at all, while the twittersphere is up in arms in contrast.

Yes - we're only talking about two data points. But my gut tells me there's something here.
