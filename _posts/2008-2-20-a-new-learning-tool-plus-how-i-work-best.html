title: "A New Learning Tool (Plus: How I Work Best)"
---
<a href="http://www.livemocha.com/">LiveMocha</A> might just be the ticket to push me over the top in finally sticking with a new language. It was featured in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/business/17novel.html?ex=1360990800&en=284f2adf8221c428&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">New York Times</A> yesterday and also kindly emailed to me by <a href="http://web.mac.com/gracerwright">Grace</A>. I have completed lesson 1 in Espanol and am very pleased with the combination of audio and text. The site itself is aesthetically pleasing and you feel like you are playing a game, especially with the Magnet ("make a sentence") section. <br /><br />The site also allows you to submit samples of writing and even speaking in the language you are learning, and leverages the power of the masses to give you feedback - every time you submit something, you are given the option of reviewing another person's submission in YOUR native language. Brilliant!<br /><br />Side note for the record: I took the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</A> test (or one version of it, the one that popped up first on Google). It typed me as an ENTJ. To translate: <b>E</B>xtroverted, not Introverted; i<b>N</B>tution, not Sensing; <b>T</B>hinking, not Feeling; and <b>J</B>udging, not Perceiving. I note this here only because I tend to forget quickly and then have to take the test again, and probably register a different result every time. Now I can test this hypothesis.<br /><br />Tomorrow: the news from Old Nassau.
