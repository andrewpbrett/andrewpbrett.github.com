Since I didn't register in NY in time to vote on Super Tuesday, I'll vote electronically here, in the form that is best suited to casting votes in general: a preferential ballot:<br /><br />1a: Mike Bloomberg<br />1: Barack Obama<br />2: John McCain<br /><br />Beyond this point, if one of these three people are not running in the general election, I don't know if I'd really want my vote cast in favor of any other candidate. Unless Arnold runs after terminating the Constitution (via amendment of course).
