This is a blatant plug, but they have earned it. <p><a href='http://rimuhosting.com/landing.jsp?s=ilink13' title='Java and Linux VPS Hosting by RimuHosting'>RimuHosting<br/><img src='http://rimuhosting.com/images/promo/rh_vpspowered_120_60.png' alt='Java and Linux VPS Hosting by RimuHosting' /></a></p><br />I've been using RimuHosting for the new project I've been working on, and their support is nothing short of amazing. There have been a number of times that I've gotten stuck with some sort of config issue, sent them an email about it, gone to bed, and woke up the next morning to find that the problem was solved. I highly recommend them.
