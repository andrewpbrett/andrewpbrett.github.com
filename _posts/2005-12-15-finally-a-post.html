title: "Finally, a post"
---
Clearly my lack of posts for the last, oh, 2 months has been the result of nothing interesting happening in the world, and the overall poor quality of the media coverage of said world.<br /><br />Now, finally, there is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/l15climate.html">something worthy of a post</A>. Clearly the man who wrote the second letter down is a genius. His concision is remarkable, and his insights are so great that all world leaders should immediately turn their ears to him.<br /><br />That man, of course, is yours truly.
