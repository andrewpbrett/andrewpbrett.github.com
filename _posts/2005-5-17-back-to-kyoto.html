title: "Back to Kyoto"

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1485595,00.html?gusrc=rss">134 US cities</a> have pledged to cut emissions by as much as the US would have had to had it signed on to Kyoto.<br /><br />This is, obviously, great news.  When I took apart Kyoto, it was as an international treaty that exempted some major players in climate change and thus strayed from the idea that a treaty should get everyone to "sit down together."  If individuals or cities want to take the first step themselves, more power to them (pun intended); many people it seems are starting to see the writing (or the thermometer) on the wall and realize that this is going to be dealt with eventually and it's profitable to mobilize sooner rather than later.
