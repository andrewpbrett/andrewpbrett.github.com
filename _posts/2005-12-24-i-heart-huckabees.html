<i>Yes, I care about the marsh and the woods. Albert was not gonna save them his way.<br /><br />You don't go through the back door with a poem and a bonnet.<br /><br />You go through the front door with a tie, and you own the marsh and the woods.<br /><br />That's how you're gonna save them.</i> <br /><br />Amen.
