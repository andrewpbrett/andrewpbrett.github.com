On the heels of Microsoft buying a stake in Facebook, I thought I'd create an account over at <a href="http://www.orkut.com">orkut</a>, Google's social networking site, just out of curiosity. <br /><br />I have to say, I don't like what I saw. I now have 'close' friends versus acquaintances? I'm asked to list my fashion sense (and am given a series of multiple choices)? Hmm. Doesn't sit well. The sample pages I randomly took a look at weren't too promising either. Facebook is also more aesthetically pleasing as well. <br /><br />Perhaps things will start changing as Google's <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/07/googles-social-networking-projects.html">social netwoking project</A> starts to take off. For now my account with orkut will likely remain fairly defunct. <br /><br />Historical note: first ever post via mobile phone.<br /><br />Update: Google <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/technology/31google.html?ex=1351569600&en=bf1e95c268086ff5&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">will open</A> the orkut platform to developers.
