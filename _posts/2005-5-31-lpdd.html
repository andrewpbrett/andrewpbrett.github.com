LPDD, of course, stands for "limited posting due to dial-up," a situation which will be remedied by tomorrow, hopefully, and certainly by the end of the week.<br /><br />One thing that is still cool even over 40 kbps is that <s>GM</s> GE (whoops!) continues to provide "free passes" to the Economist's premium content in exchange for you watching one of their ads. The ads seems loosely tied to their new Ecomagination campaign, which makes it even better. I'd include a link to my post on the Ecomagination thing, and to Joel Makower's thoughts on it which are the most extensive and interesting I've seen, but it would be faster for all parties if you just looked for those links yourself. They aren't hard to find.
