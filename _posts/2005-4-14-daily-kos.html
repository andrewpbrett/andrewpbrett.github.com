Most recent post from the old site:<br /><br />It is as if every time I mention Daily Kos on here, they manage to outdo themselves.  Let's take a look at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/4/14/131745/068">this post</a>.  Now, I don't know if the poor resolution is supposed to trick the reader or what.  If you don't look closely, you might think that the first line is something like November 2 or 3, as a reference to when Bush was elected, as you would expect since this post is allegedly trying to show that Bush's election was actually bad for the economy.  But no.  That first line is March 11; the second one is March 31.  I don't want to infer anything, but someone had to deliberately take out the other lines in the original graph, which you can see by clicking on the image.  These graphs don't show anything.  The first graph shows the last three months; but look at the graph for the last <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EDJI&t=6m&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=">six months</A>.  Honestly, is this a joke, Kos?  If this graph shows anything, it shows a strong RISE in the stock market after Bush's reelection.  This is evidence of "mining."  Are you trying to lose readers?
