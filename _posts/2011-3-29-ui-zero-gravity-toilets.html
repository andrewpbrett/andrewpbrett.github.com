<p>As I'm building out the user interface for <a href="http://cakehealth.com">Cake Health</a>, I'm constantly running into a problem that many people face when building an application: *You* know exactly how it works and how it's supposed to function, but a first-time user is almost certainly going to be lost. 
</p><p>
It's so easy to say "I'll use a wizard" or "I'll add some helper text, or a tool tip" - but this is almost always the wrong decision. <a href="http://twitter.com/BillNguyen/status/52575405953126400">If you find yourself having to explain the interface, you've already lost</a>. 
</p><p>
One of my favorite scenes from "2001: A Space Odyssey" features the main character poring over a long list of instructions for using a Zero Gravity Toilet: 
</p><p>

His pensive expression is presumably caused by the race between Nature's increasingly insistent call and his rate of reading comprehension. 
</p><p>
Similar instructions can be seen in other shots. It puts a subtle but poignant addition on the film's theme that technology has advanced to a "magical" level and yet has also rendered its creators totally dependent on its sometimes flawed design. 
</p><p>
Moral of the story: if you start to see instructions on your interface, stop. Pretend that understanding it is the only thing preventing your users from relieving themselves in zero gravity.
