title: "USA TODAY, tomorrow the world"
---
While I don't understand why "today" is all caps, I have a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20050617/letfeat17.art.htm">letter</A> in that paper today. It's the third one down.<br /><br />It's not that good. I like what I write at <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org">Gristmill</A> much better. I get more than 68 words there.
