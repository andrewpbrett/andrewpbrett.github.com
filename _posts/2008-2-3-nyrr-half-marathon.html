So, I'm a little late in posting this, but last Sunday I did the New York Road Runner's half-marathon. The race is one of five (one per boro) and was held in Central Park. <br /><br />I did a minimal amount (read: zero) training for this race. I was going along surprisingly well, holding a 7:00/mile pace for the first 10 miles (first mile was under 6:30, yikes). After that though, I slowed down considerably after the combination of the cold (32 F at racetime), my attire (shorts), and the hills in the northern sections of the park started to take a toll on my calves. For the last two miles it felt like I was running with my quads only, and that large weights had taken the place of my entirely stiffened calves. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.brightroom.com/view_user_event.asp?EVENTID=32232&ID=46138566&FROM=photos&BIB=5603">Pictures</A>
