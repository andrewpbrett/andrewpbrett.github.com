My paper is cranked out; I now plan to sit on it for a few hours and then make some final changes before I email it in at 4.  If you really want to, you can read it <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/GEO339">here</A>.<br /><br />In the meantime, I am going to start working on putting together my NGO proposal for wind power development in Turkey for NES 265.
