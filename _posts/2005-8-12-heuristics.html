I think I have discovered the word for a lot of what I've been mulling over lately: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristics</A>. See my rambling <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/comments/2005/8/11/22416/5755/1#1">comment</a> this morning for more.<br /><br />It's also a good feeling to see that Daniel Kahneman, who will be my professor this fall, is mentioned in almost all of the material related to the matter.
