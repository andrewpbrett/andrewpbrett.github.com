title: "The Dissident"

"<a href="http://www.the-dissident.com/">The Dissident</a>" made its campus debut today, and I have to say that while I was suspicious at first of a magazine that seemed to espouse dissidence for its own sake, I thought some of the articles were pretty good. One is by Bryan Caplan, who writes for EconLog if I'm not mistaken. His <a href="http://www.the-dissident.com/illiteracy.shtml">article</a> on economic illiteracy was particularly good.<br /><br />Working the <a href="http://www.filibusterfrist.com/">filibuster</a> tomorrow from 8-12. Come out! I am hoping that some of the people who have opposing views will be up by now. I heard there was a spirited yet <i>extremely</i> civil debate/discussion last night.  Good stuff.
