title: "To Do: Integrate Jott and Remember the Milk"
---
I've been using <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</A> for a little while now and have been pretty pleased with the results. Today I stumbled across a service called <a href="http://www.jott.com">Jott</A>, which transcribes voice into text and can emails you the result. Two obvious uses: voicemails and transforming your phone into a personal voice recorder/to-do list generator. Since Jott will send an email to any address you specify as a contact, (e.g. your Remember the Milk inbox address), it's pretty easy to integrate the two yourself by hand; however, poking around their blog revealed that the smart people over there have <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2007/11/jott-your-tasks.html">already thought of that</A> and have automated the process. Kudos.
