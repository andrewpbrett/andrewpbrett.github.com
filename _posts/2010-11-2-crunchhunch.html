Guess who wrote the TechCrunch post based on the headline with <a href="http://crunchhunch.com">Crunchhunch</a>.

A few weeks ago I was out to drinks with some friends when the topic of TechCrunch headlines came up. I asserted that I could guess with "greater than 90% accuracy" who wrote a post based solely on the headline. It gets even easier if you can see the image used in the excerpt.

Fast-forward to last Saturday, when I found myself with an unusual amount of free time (funny, that). Having been reminded of the idea earlier that week after <a href="http://www.paulcarr.com">Paul</a>'s suggested domain name turned out to be available, I decided to see what I could put together. A few hours later, and <a href="http://crunchhunch.com">voila</a>. Since then I've made a few tweaks, courtesy of the creative department (Paul), in the form of some copy edits and some additions to what appears after a right/wrong answer.

Just a fun little app. Enjoy. If you're a designer and the site makes you want to gouge your eyes out with your photoshop license, get in touch :-)
