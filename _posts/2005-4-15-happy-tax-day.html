Happy Tax Day!  In light of the occasion, I thought I'd repost something from before, since none of the old posts are available, which raises another question: should I import all of the old posts by hand?  Feel free to share your thoughts on whether clicking through to LiveJournal or the old site is too much of a hassle.  Here's the (shortened) March 9th post:<br /><br />Alan Greenspan discussed (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/04/politics/04tax.html?8br">here</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/03/03/news/economy/tax_reform/">here</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3689-2005Mar3.html">here</a>, although that article misses the point, I think) the possibility of a consumption tax in some incarnation. This is mildly interesting to me because if it gets passed anytime soon it could vastly change how much I have to send to Uncle Sam.<span style="">&nbsp; In general, and without getting into my personal finances, I would probably be better off under a consumption tax of some kind, although that seems counterintuitiveâ€¦anyway, I'll be watching you, Alan.<br /><br />(End of March 9th post)<br /><br />While on the subject of taxes, the estate tax, aka the death tax, has been in the news as well, so I thought I'd mention that.  While I like the idea of everyone starting off with a level playing field, there is bound to be a disincentive to earn if you think it's all going to get taxed away instead of left to your progeny, and a surprisingly high number of Americans do think that the estate tax will affect them.  Whether this is the eternal optimism or misinformation, I don't know.
