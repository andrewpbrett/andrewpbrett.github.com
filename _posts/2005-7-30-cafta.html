title: "CAFTA"

In principle, free trade is good. But the US has got to practice what it preaches. Every time I hear someone praise CAFTA because of the agricultural market that it opens up for the US farm industry, I cringe, since the US farm industry is so heavily subsidized.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/editorials/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/opinion/112271600760650.xml&coll=2">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a> came out in support of the agreement, citing the vote of Steve Latourette (my representative) as the "deciding vote." Sure, it was 217-216, but that makes everyone's vote the deciding vote.
