title: "Google Reader Stats"

Inspired by <a href="http://www.gawande.com/">Atul Gawande</A>'s advice to "measure something," I decided to start keeping track of how long I spent each day tabbing through items in my Google Reader. Naturally, I have made this process a <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/02/18/how-to-stop-checking-e-mail-on-the-evenings-and-weekends/">batch process</A>, done once per weekday. <br /><br />It has now been one week, so I have five data points. I wanted to see if any strong trends emerged, so I put the data in a Google Spreadsheet, publicly available <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCyO8doXJBwJZt6lkrYIhRw">here</A>. I'm still tooling around with it, but I was also excited to try out the <a href="http://googlegadgetsapi.blogspot.com/2008/03/new-possibilities-with-gadgets.html">gadget feature</A>, which should let me embed the two charts I came up with right on my blog as gadgets: <br /><br /><iframe width='358' height='286' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' src='http://hr0gmsrl-a.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?up__table_query_url=http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Ftq%3Frange%3DE1%253AF13%26key%3DpCyO8doXJBwJZt6lkrYIhRw%26gid%3D0%26pub%3D1&up_title=Google%20Reader%20Times&up_labelx=Items%20Read&up_labely=Minutes&up_legend=4&up__table_query_refresh_interval=0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fig%2Fmodules%2Fscatter-chart.xml' style='border: 1px solid #cccccc'></iframe><br /><br /><iframe width='358' height='286' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' src='http://hr0gmsrl-a.gmodules.com/ig/ifr?up__table_query_url=http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Ftq%3Frange%3DG2%253AH11%26key%3DpCyO8doXJBwJZt6lkrYIhRw%26gid%3D0%26pub%3D1&up_title=Time%20per%20Item%20vs.%20Shared%20Items&up_labelx=Time%20per%20Item%20(min)&up_labely=Shared%20Items&up_legend=4&up__table_query_refresh_interval=0&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fig%2Fmodules%2Fscatter-chart.xml' style='border: 1px solid #cccccc'></iframe><br /><br />Nothing tremendously interesting or pretty, but for right now I just wanted to see if the pipes could be connected so to speak. <br /><br />One thing I noticed was that the standard scatterplot falls victim to standard scatterplot syndrome: you can only display two values on it, i.e., you can't make the points sized or colored based on a third or fourth column of values.<br /><br />Thing is, there's a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/dev_guide.html">developer's API</A> for these things, but currently there are no available charts that allow for this multi-dimensional type of scatter plot. I wonder if this is something that one could knock out in a weekend...
