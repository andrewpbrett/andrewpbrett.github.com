title: "Ecomagination, Filibuster"
---
GE launched a series of ads touting what it calls "ecomagination" two days ago.  Since then it's been mentioned at <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2005/5/8/222321/6123">Gristmill</A> and by <a href="http://makower.typepad.com/joel_makower/">Joel Makower</A>, among others.  It's very exciting.  And their <a href="http://www.geimaginationcubed.com/LaunchPage">sketchpad</A> is cool as well.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.filibusterfrist.com">filibuster</A> continues, in Washington DC now.  Both NJ Senators are slated to speak.
