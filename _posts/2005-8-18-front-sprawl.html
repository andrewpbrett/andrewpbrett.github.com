What could be even more appalling to James Howard Kunstler and company than the suburbs? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/15/national/15exurb.html?ex=1281758400&amp;en=1c3dc0afa5dd8b9e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">The exurbs</a>.<br />If the extension of government services to the suburbs is a huge money sink, the extension of those services to the exurbs is a black hole. This is one issue mentioned in the three <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/opinion/l17exurbs.html">letters to the editor</a> in response to the NYT article.<br />KB Home is the big, bad developer in this story, and the exurb in question is New River, Florida.<br /><blockquote>They know almost to the dollar how much buyers are willing to pay to exchange a longer commute for more space, a sense of higher status and the feeling of security.<br><br />...<br><br />The answer, the company decided, is that a house in New River must be $12,000 cheaper than the same house in the north Tampa suburbs, 15 minutes closer to downtown.</blockquote><br />Suddenly, the situation described in last week's <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/10/AR2005081002110_pf.html">article</a> doesn't sound that bad -- many things are a five-minute drive, and everything is a fifteen-minute drive away.<br /><br />The effects of <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2005/8/16/182925/221">three-dollar gas</a> occur on different timetables in different sectors of the economy. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/16/AR2005081601772.html">retail industry</a> may be feeling the effects already. It takes longer for people to switch to more fuel efficient cars, and even longer for people to express that they value a shorter commute by increasing the demand for homes that aren't "in the middle of nowhere."<br /><br />Might it be time to concede that people are unwilling to relinquish cars and instead promote communities where car use can be minimized?
