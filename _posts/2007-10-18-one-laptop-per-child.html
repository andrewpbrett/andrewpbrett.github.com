title: "One Laptop Per Child"
---
The One Laptop Per Child program has the mission of bringing, you guessed it, one laptop to every child in the developing world. They haven't reached their stated goal of a $100 laptop, but $200 still isn't bad, and the laptops have entered "mass production" mode. You could buy one with the refund from your iPhone. <br /><br />Starting November 12, they'll be kicking off the "Give one get one" program - for $400, you can donate a laptop to a child in a developing country and get one for yourself to give to a child of your choice (or just keep, I suppose).<br /><br /><a href="http://laptop.org">laptop.org</A>
