So I am now blogging from the filibuster tent at the <A href="http://www.filibusterfrist.com">Frist Center Filibuster Protest</A>.  We're listening to The Art of Worldly Wisdom by Baltasar Gracian, as read by Katy Lankester.  This is one of the times that I am really impressed with Princeton students, to keep this up around the clock.  This is a really nice PowerBook G4 that they've got here, although I have no idea whose it is.  Apparently I am now the organizer on duty...
