I don't think I'll do a very good job writing a review for a novel, so I'll
say that I liked [The Unbearable Lightness of Being](http://www.amazon.com
/Unbearable-Lightness-Being-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060932139) and list some of
the things I liked in particular.

  
- The characters are very easy to identify with, particularly Tomas and Tereza, but truly all of them.   
  
- The book has some very interesting philosophical undertones. In a way it reminded me of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.   
  
- The writing style is easy to read (though I understand it was translated into English from the original).   
  
Though the writing was easy to read, at the end of the book I felt that I
could read it again (more slowly perhaps) and pick up on a whole new level of
detail that I didn't before.

  
A related point: one thing I didn't like so much were the abstractions and
tangents that the author would invoke from time to time. I would sometimes
wind up lost and, like I said, not really feel that I had grasped the full
level of detail. But in general the discussions of the abstractions are what
make the book interesting.
