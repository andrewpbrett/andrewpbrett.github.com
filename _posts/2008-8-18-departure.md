Tomorrow I will begin making my way to Blanc-Sablon, Canada, for the 2008
International Endurance Aventure, otherwise known as the [Coast
Raid](http://www.coastraid.com/en/index.html). We've got a great team together
for what should be a very exciting race.

  
The race organizers have informed us that the teams' progress will be
monitored and posted online. Right now the site directs
[here](http://www.coastraidtracking.com/), but right now it looks like last
year's teams are up there. There's also a [video
feed](http://www.enduranceaventure.tv/) that I'm assuming will be updated as
the race progresses.
