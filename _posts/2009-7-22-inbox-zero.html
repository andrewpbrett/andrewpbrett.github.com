title: "Inbox: Zero. Google Reader: not so much"

<p class='post_body'> 
I'm a big advocate of the "Inbox Zero" philosophy of email management. I don't have the <a href="http://www.nerdmeritbadges.com/products/inbox-zero">merit badge</a>, and I don't think it needs to be <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">quite so extensive</a>, but I still like to keep things pristine. 
<BR><BR> 
My RSS reader is another story; I rarely clear it out entirely. When I go through the items (once per day), I'll mark a few choice ones as unread for further perusal and keep plugging through the chaff. Once I start to hit things that I've seen before, it means I've finished the boring part. 
<BR><BR> 
There's usually somewhere between 10 and 25 items, spread over a week or so, that remain marked as unread. These savory morsels get read, re-read, shared, emailed, or (theoretically) turned into fodder for blog posts. The best ones <strike><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-oQ">are approved by the Senate and become a law!</a></strike> get starred and saved for all time. 
<BR><BR> 
I prefer this system over the inbox zero method because it allows the ideas in the posts to seep a little deeper into the gray matter. It's a fundamentally different mindset that you're in; often if someone emails me an article I'll use <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2008/05/share-anything-anytime-anywhere.html">this handy bookmarklet</a> to get it into Reader and then move it to a separate folder.

I still haven't decided what to do with the <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2009/07/following-liking-and-people-searching.html">new features the Reader team keeps rolling out</a>, though.
