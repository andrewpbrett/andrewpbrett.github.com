title: "House Energy Bill"
---
The House just passed an <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/energy_pdfs_2.htm">Energy Bill</A>, which, among other things, amends the Clean Air Act so that "downwind" states don't have to meet stricter regulations util "upwind" states do the same.  While the issue of air pollution traveling from state to state is a big one, giving some states exemptions is not the way to deal with it.
