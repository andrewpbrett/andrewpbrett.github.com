I know.  Kos again.  I don't want this to turn into a Kos-watch blog.  But I am finally starting to sift through the RSS boxes, and it's not even the second one down before I get to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/4/27/11456/3671">this gem</A> from Kos.  Seems he's got his hands on the story about the Patterns of Global Terrorism Report getting canned (which you could have read about on <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~abrett/2005/04/whats-better-than-flawed-report-no.html">my blog</A> ten days ago) and he's all in a huff.  Nowhere, not in the post, and not in the 102 <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/4/27/11456/3671">comments</A> that follow, does anybody mention the fact that a completely new methodology is being used, which has <a href="http://counterterror.typepad.com/the_counterterrorism_blog/2005/04/goodby_patterns.html">more to do with the increase</A> than an actual spike.<br /><br />I take that back.  There is now <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/comments/2005/4/27/11456/3671/102#102">one person</A> who mentions it. :-)
