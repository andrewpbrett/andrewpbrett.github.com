title: "Beyond Red and Blue"

<a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2005/5/12/133854/685">This post</a> at MyDD is really interesting.  Not only does this <a href="http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?PageID=943">study</a> go, as promised, beyond red and blue, but it provides a questionnaire (one page) that you can <a href="http://typology.people-press.org/typology/">fill out</a> to determine which group you would have fallen into had you taken the survey. The questionnaire itself is a little lacking, since you only have four choices for each question and some of the wording is dubious. But very worth a look.<br /><br />Apparently, I am an "upbeat," which Chris Bowers is ready to throw in with the Republicans, and which one of the commenters has <a href="http://www.mydd.com/comments/2005/5/12/133854/685/3#3">identified</A> as the "mythical swing voter."
