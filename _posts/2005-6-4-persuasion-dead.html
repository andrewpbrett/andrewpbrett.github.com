title: "Persuasion, Dead?"

Matt Miller <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/04/opinion/04miller_oped.html">proposes just that</A> today in his guest column.  Read the whole thing ;-)<br /><br />I don't think persuasion is dead.  This gets, if it is really taken to its fullest line of thought, into some issues about how the human mind actually works, (How We Know What Isn't So, etc.) and is really starting to crop up over and over again for me, which makes me think that a salient argument against taking a year off of school next year is that I won't be in this class I'm really looking forward to, The Psychology of Decision Making.  That is still up in the air...
