>A pair of Stanford freshmen came in next, with an idea for a mobile-phone application called QuadMob, which would allow you to locate your closest friends on a map in real time... "On Friday night, every single week, I go to a party, and somehow you just lose your friends -- people roll out to different parties. And I always have to text people, 'Where are you, which party are you at?' and I have to do that for, like, ten friends, and that's just a huge pain point." 

>The QuadMob candidates did not get a Thiel Fellowship.
