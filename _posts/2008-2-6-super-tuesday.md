Since I didn't register in NY in time to vote on Super Tuesday, I'll vote
electronically here, in the form that is best suited to casting votes in
general: a preferential ballot:

  
1a: Mike Bloomberg

1: Barack Obama

2: John McCain

  
Beyond this point, if one of these three people are not running in the general
election, I don't know if I'd really want my vote cast in favor of any other
candidate. Unless Arnold runs after terminating the Constitution (via
amendment of course).
