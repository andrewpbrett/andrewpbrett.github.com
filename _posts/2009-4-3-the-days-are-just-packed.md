1. Create "Maximo Park Radio" on Pandora


2. Happen upon the song "We Don't Think, We Know," by Maritime


3. Catch the allusion in the lyrics: "All the days are just packed / And we're
asleep in the trees"


4. See if anyone else caught it -- [nope](http://www.google.com/search?q=we+don%27t+think+we+know+calvin+and+hobbes&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a)! (Well, they didn't write about it anyway)


5. Write about it


6. Smile :-)
