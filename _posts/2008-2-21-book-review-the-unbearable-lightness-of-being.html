**Reposted from Goodreads because I don't think that's searchable**<br /><br />I don't think I'll do a very good job writing a review for a novel, so I'll say that I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unbearable-Lightness-Being-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060932139">The Unbearable Lightness of Being</A> and list some of the things I liked in particular. <br /><br />- The characters are very easy to identify with, particularly Tomas and Tereza, but truly all of them. <br /><br />- The book has some very interesting philosophical undertones. In a way it reminded me of <span style="font-style:italic;">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. <br /></span><br />- The writing style is easy to read (though I understand it was translated into English from the original). <br /><br />Though the writing was easy to read, at the end of the book I felt that I could read it again (more slowly perhaps) and pick up on a whole new level of detail that I didn't before. <br /><br />A related point: one thing I didn't like so much were the abstractions and tangents that the author would invoke from time to time. I would sometimes wind up lost and, like I said, not really feel that I had grasped the full level of detail. But in general the discussions of the abstractions are what make the book interesting.
