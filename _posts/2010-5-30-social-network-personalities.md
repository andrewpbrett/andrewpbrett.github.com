A few weeks ago I [remarked](http://www.google.com/buzz/andybrett/FLoRQUeaLpz
/If-Facebook-is-the-people-you-went-to-high-school) on some of the differences
I'd noticed between the people I was connected with on Facebook, Twitter, and
Google Buzz. Generally speaking, I'd noticed that people on Buzz tend to be
quite a bit smarter/wonkier than your average joe - "the people who actually
did the reading [in class] and got really into it."

  
I now have some anecdotal evidence to back this up. Behold this [excellent
Charlie Rose interview of John Doerr](http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/24
/tcdisrupt-doerr-rose/) from TechCrunch Disrupt, specifically the share counts
on each network:

Charlie Rose is extremely talented at painting broad intellectual strokes and
pulling out larger patterns, which is exactly what happened. Stimulating, but
not really link bait - the retweet count is actually on the low side for a
TechCrunch post. But the Buzz count is through the roof - higher than Facebook
and nearly half of the retweet count.

  
Compare this with [Exhibit B](http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/29/guy-who-copied-
digg-slams-digg-for-copying-twitter/):

The post is much more controversial, but it's not really hitting any
intellectual high notes. Barely any buzz at all, while the twittersphere is up
in arms in contrast.

  
Yes - we're only talking about two data points. But my gut tells me there's
something here.
