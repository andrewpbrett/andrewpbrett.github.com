I do believe that this will be the first time in the history of this blog (if you don't count NYTimes letters and writings on <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org">Gristmill</a>) that I'll be linking to something that I had a hand in writing:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.geotimes.org/current/article.html?id=feature_democracy.html">Democracy, GDP, and Natural Disasters</A>.<br /><br />Frank Greve, a journalist who apparently writes for the <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/goodnews/story/20380.html">McClatchey Washington Bureau</A> and both the <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/goodnews/story/20380.html">English</A> and <a href="http://www.elnuevoherald.com/209/story/102358.html">Spanish</A> language versions of the Miami Herald, wrote an article about the original paper as well.
