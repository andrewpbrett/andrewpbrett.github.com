This is a really great survey of the current landscape in the health care
industry. One quote from a self-insured employer jumps out:

  

> Last year, MasterBrand, which has some 7,000 U.S. employees, started tying
their insurance-premium contributions to their health-risk factors. Those who
score poorly on measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, body-mass index
and tobacco use pay more each week.
