title: "Ad-free Pandora"

Yesterday I subscribed to [Pandora's new ad-free service](http://blog.pandora.
com/pandora/archives/2009/05/pandora_one_upg.html), "Pandora One." The tipping
point came when 'Graceland' was followed by an audio ad for Terminator: The
College Years.

  
The service is, in my opinion, perfectly priced, at $36/year. I suspect that
this figure was chosen (as opposed to, say, $40/year) because it prompts you
to do the mental math and figure out - for yourself - that it's only 10
cents/day. Brings you back to the days of pledge week on NPR, doesn't it? And
speaking of which, how great is technology that it can exempt subscribers from
requests for money or ads? I remember that being my main mental counter-
argument to Bob Edwards - if I send you money, I still have to listen to you
solicit us for two weeks every few months!

  
Anyway, the service is great. No ads of any kind, really great audio quality,
plus a sleek desktop app with built in growl-type notifications of what song
is playing. I'm also hoping that, since it's a stand-alone app, this means
that I'll be able to map the keyboard controls for iTunes to control Pandora
instead. If anyone has already figured out how to do this, please let me know!
