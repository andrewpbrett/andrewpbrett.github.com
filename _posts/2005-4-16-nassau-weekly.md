Usually I just read the Verbatim and maybe look at some of Arthur's pictures,
but this week's [Nassau Weekly](http://www.nassauweekly.com/) is pretty good,
especially the [feature
article](http://www.nassauweekly.com/view_article.php?id=291), a methodical
and thorough dissection of "Tangled Up in Blue" by Eleanor Barkhorn.
