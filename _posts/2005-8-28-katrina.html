Katrina is <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at2+shtml/151733.shtml?3day">bearing down on New Orleans</A>, and is scheduled to arrive at about 9 am Monday morning. It's been upgraded to a category five storm.<br /><br />Chris C. Mooney has some <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=2090">thoughts</A> over at his blog. His article from May which he cites also contains this ominous tidbit:<br /><br /><em>In the wake of such a tragedy [a "direct hit from a powerful hurricane on New Orleans"], some may even question the wisdom of trying to rebuild the city at all.</em>
