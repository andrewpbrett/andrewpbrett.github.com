For all the hubbub about the Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Kelo v. City of New London</em> that eminent domain could be applied to cases where "economic development" was the public use in question, the response of the state legislatures <a href="http://www.castlecoalition.org/legislation/states/index.asp">has been swift</A>. The decision did not prevent states from making their own laws regarding the scope of eminent domain, and public opposition to the ruling has been widspread and bipartisan. An <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-02-eminent-domain_x.htm?csp=34">article</A> in <EM>USA TODAY</em> detailed the states' response and had this to say:<blockquote>In Washington, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said his office received more calls from constituents angry about this case than it did for the Supreme Court ruling that limited displays of the Ten Commandments on public property<br />...<br />"We don't like anybody messing with our dogs, our guns, our hunting rights or trying to take property from us," says [Alabama] state Sen. Jack Biddle, a sponsor of the law.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.castlecoalition.org">Castle Coalition</A> is a great resource for eminent domain issues and activism if you're so inclined.
