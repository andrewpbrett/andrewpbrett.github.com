I might be the only one, but there's usually at least one quote in a Paul Graham essay that makes me laugh out loud. To wit:

>Now [Google's] results seem inspired by the Scientologist principle that what's true is what's true for you. And the pages don't have the clean, sparse feel they used to. Google search results used to look like the output of a Unix utility. Now if I accidentally put the cursor in the wrong place, anything might happen.

The rest of the essay is brilliant as usual. I won't try to distill it further.
