Posted some thoughts [on Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-went-wrong-with-
Jawbones-UP/answer/Andy-Brett) after a few weeks wearing the UP. Three key
flaws:

- I still have to tell the UP what "mode" I'm in (normal, sleeping, or exercising).

- Syncing is awkward and unreliable.

- No API/data export, and no web interface.

I'm pretty excited for the [Basis](http://mybasis.com/) to arrive, as it
appears to address all three.
