I really hope that this becomes more common, and not the exception that proves
the rule. No middlemen, no signing up for something. Just a transaction
between a creator and the people that want to enjoy something and will pay
money to do so.

I'm also just going to assume that it was my [question on
Quora](http://www.quora.com/How-much-did-it-cost-Louis-CK-to-produce-Live-at-
the-Beacon-Theater-Has-he-made-a-profit-on-it) that got him to post an
[update](https://buy.louisck.net/statement) on the (impressive) sales figures
to date.

Further, from the [AMA on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/n9tef/
hi_im_louis_ck_and_this_is_a_thing/):

> It's like that thing in the movie "Twister" where they send a bunch of
little data collecting balls up into a tornado and just download the lovely
results. The whole things has been like that. From the moment it went online
and i saw the result of every decision i made. the last question the web guys
asked me before we posted was if I wanted the mail list button defaulted to
"opt in" or "opt out" and i said start it at opt out. It's such a tiny thing
but I keep hearing about it from people.
